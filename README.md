Observations: Above results show images of the gender-based analysis. Looks like females spend way too much time on the site but don't contribute much to the revenue.

Observations: Above results show images of the age-based analysis. Interesting to see that the age group 18-24 does not contribute as much revenue as other age groups but people from that age group spends a lot of time on the site browsing and surfing.

Observations: Above results show images of the device-based analysis. Revenue is contributed mostly through mobile phone devices but not so much through desktop devices. It's interesting to see an opposite trend on the duration metric.

## Conclusion
The whole analysis helped us filter out demographic segments of the user base who actually contribute to revenue over the months long time-frame we analysed. This helped us focus more on the advertisements campaigns and save revenue by removing advertisements on low contributing segments.
